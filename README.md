# Comparing-Algorithms-Emotion-Recognition
This project was meant to compare machine learning algorithms in order to recognize facial expression with single-class algorithms and multi-class algorithms. 
The data was split into training and testing sets. 
The algorithms performed were PCA and LDA, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM (Support Vector Machine).
Confusion matrices were created to analyze the true label vs. the predicted labels.
